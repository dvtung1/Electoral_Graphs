        <p id="powerDescription" class="mt-5 text-justify d-none">This map is color coded with a darker green correlating to a higher electoral vote per capita, and when compared with the racial map, some patterns start to emerge. As seen, certain areas like Alaska, Wyoming, the Dakotas, and a few New England states give much more power to their population than states like California or Illinois. As a result, candidates who have support of more voters there are more than guaranteed the state, while in others, even if the candidate has a large amount of support, voters aren't able to have as much say in where their electoral college votes go. 
        More interestingly, these states are also ones with a larger amount of white inhabitants. This correlates to minorities not being able to have their voices heard and is detrimental to the social status quo in the US.</p>
        <p id="racialDescription" class="mt-5 text-justify d-none">The map above is color coded by the percentage of Caucasians living in the state, with more blue correlating to a lower percentage, and red correlating to a higher percentage of white voters. As shown, more of northern states, as well as the midwest, contain more white people, and more white voters. When put together with the voting map, it highlights how the electoral college is biased towards certain groups.</p>
