## Project Breakdown

### Intro
With the election finally coming to a close, most of us are just glad that it’s over, there are many people who are left confused with the deeper issues of the election. How could it take 5 days declare that a candidate with 5 million more votes was the winner? In American politics, the short answer would be the electoral college, but the deeper answer has not really been disclosed to the public.

### Intial results
While many have heard that the electoral college makes elections fairer, who is really receiving the benefits of this “electoral college.” We set out to try and measure the affect of the electoral college in the election and diversity’s role in electoral votes by measuring racial demographics and electoral votes per capita. Our results show that the states with higher electoral votes per capita tend to be states with a very large white makeup, with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii.

### Thoughts
While no system is perfect, we did not expect almost that every US state with high electoral votes per person would be very high white – makeup away from the coast. Whether intentional or not, it does seem that the electoral college does have a demographic that it assists the most, and we believe our website highlights some of the inequalities of the system.
